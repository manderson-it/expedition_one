**Reaching the drop zone**

Every travel day is exhausting. Different time, temperature, sun exposure or
lack thereof.

Anyways, I made it to the drop zone and landed safely. However, a global weather
phenomenon called Google Cloud severely limited visibility and made traversing
the Arctiq impossible today.
Coincidentally, the small research station called [Qwiklabs](https://google.qwiklabs.com/ "Google Cloud Qwiklabs")
provides some guidance on how to start the traverse. The researchers kind of
gamified their teachings with quests containing multiple hands-on labs.

Here are the labs I completed today:
- A Tour of Qwiklabs and the Google Cloud Platform
- Creating a Virtual Machine (they blamed me for crashing their lab on the first try)
- Compute Engine: Qwik Start - Windows

It is time to rest and hope that the weather conditions will improve tomorrow.

**More questing**

Progress! However, I am getting ahead of myself.
In the morning, I finished the remaining labs and hence completed the quest *GCP essentials*.
The completed labs are:
- Getting Started with Cloud Shell & gcloud
- Kubernetes Engine: Qwik Start
- Set Up Network and HTTP Load Balancers

What to do with the rest of my morning? Huh, somebody must have forgotten their
documents on the table in the small dining room.
- [Google Cloud Platform Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_gce.html)
- [Cloud modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_cloud_modules.html#google)

Oh well, guess I start reading and hope conditions outside improve by noon.

**Early afternoon -** Finally, the weather conditions have improved, but I have
been advised not to venture too far from the research station. Can't hurt to
check out the perimeter and set up my first instance.
